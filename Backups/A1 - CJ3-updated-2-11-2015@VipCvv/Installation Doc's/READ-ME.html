      <td height="362" valign="top"><p><span class="style3">Requirements<br />
      </span>You will need two types of hosting for this script, &quot;Adobe Flash Media Server Hosting&quot; and regular &quot;Linux based hosting&quot;.</p>
        <p>We recommed Hostgator.com for regular hosting because our scripts were designed on Hostgator hosting.</p>
        <p>We recommend Serverrrom.net for &quot;Adobe Flash Media Server&quot; hosting because of their rock solid audio/video streams and 5 star customer service. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Login to your servers cPanel and create a database for this script and load one of the database sql files that came with the script located in the folder named &quot;Datbase SQL&quot; located in the root of the script.</p>
        <p>Upload all files onto your webserver into the public_html folder or whatever folder your plan to host the script in.<br />
        Chmod the folder named &quot;models&quot; to 777 (write permission).<br />
        <br />
        edit &quot;dbase.php&quot; located in the root folder of the script and change the database information to your database information.<br />
        edit the file settings.php to your settings. Please see the Flash Media Server &quot;READ-ME.html&quot; file located in the &quot;Flash Media Server Files&quot; folder for information on setting up your RTMP address.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="style3">Setting up the database </span><br />
      import the file Database_SQL.sql located in the &quot;Database SQL&quot; folder using the PhpMyAdmin software on your hosting control panel.</p>
      <p>The SQL file named &quot;<span class="style4">CJ3-Database-5-models-final.sql</span>&quot; will install 5 premade performer accounts into your database.<br />
        The SQL file named &quot;<span class="style4">CJ3-Database-50-models-final.sql</span>&quot; will install 50 premade performer accounts into your database. </p>
      <p>by default the script displays 50 performer thumbnails per page, provided you have 50 accounts created.</p>

    <tr>
      <td><p>This is so easy. You will need an FTP client such as FileZilla. You can get it free here.<br />
            <br />
          <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">https://filezilla-project.org/</a> </p>
        <p>FTP into your Flash Media Server and open the folder named &quot;applications&quot;. Inside that folder create a folder and name it whatever you want. (example:  &quot;adult&quot; or &quot;webcams&quot;).</p>
        <p> Upload the &quot;main.asc&quot; file into the new folder you created. Now your Flash server is setup properly.
          NEXT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
          Next you need to find your Flash hosting RTMP address. If you are using Serverroom.net for you Flash hosting then your RTMP address should look like this. <br />
            <br />
          RTMP://your-account.srfms.com/ </p>
        <p>Using the text editor of your choice open the file named &quot;settings.php&quot; which is located in the root of the script. You will see a sample RTMP address in the file code, simply replace the sample RTMP address with your real RTMP address. </p>
        <p>WAIT!  That's NOT all.... </p>
        <p>At the very end of your RTMP address you need to add a forward slash followed by the name of the folder you created in the &quot;applications&quot; folder on the Flash Media Server. So lets say you used one of my examples and named your folder &quot;webcams&quot;, your RTMP <br />
          address in the &quot;settings.php&quot; file should look like this.</p>
        <p> rtmp://your-account.srfms.com/webcams/ </p>
        <p>DO NOT FORGET THE LAST FORWARD SLASH AT THE END OF THIS URL.</p>
        <p> 
          rtmp://your-account.srfms.com/webcams<span class="style2">/</span> &lt;&lt;&lt;----- This forward slash </p>
        <p>SAVE the &quot;settings.php&quot; file and upload it to your regular <br />
          hosting server in the root folder of your script.      </p>
      <p>Flash Media Server is now setup. </p>
