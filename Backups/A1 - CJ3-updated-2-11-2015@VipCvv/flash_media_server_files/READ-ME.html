      <td><p>This is so easy. You will need an FTP client such as FileZilla.<br />
        You can get it free here.<br />
        https://filezilla-project.org/</p>
        <p>FTP into your Flash Media Server and open the folder named <br />
  &quot;applications&quot;. Inside that folder create a folder and name it <br />
          whatever you want. (example:  &quot;adult&quot; or &quot;webcams&quot;). upload the <br />
  &quot;main.asc&quot; file into the new folder you created. Now your Flash <br />
          server is setup properly.</p>
        <p>NEXT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
        <p>Next you need to find your Flash hosting RTMP address. If you <br />
          are using Serverroom.net for you Flash hosting then your RTMP <br />
          address should look like this.</p>
        <p>RTMP://your-account.srfms.com/</p>
        <p>Using the text editor of your choice open the file named &quot;settings.php&quot; which is located in the root <br />
          of the script. You will see a sample RTMP address in the file code, <br />
          simply replace the sample with your real RTMP address.</p>
        <p>WAIT!  That's NOT all....</p>
        <p>At the very end of your RTMP address you need to add a forward <br />
          slash followed by the name of the folder you created in the <br />
  &quot;applications&quot; folder on the Flash Media Server. So lets say you <br />
          used one of my examples and named your folder &quot;webcams&quot;, your RTMP <br />
          address in the &quot;settings.php&quot; file should look like this.</p>
        <p>rtmp://your-account.srfms.com/webcams/</p>
        <p>DO NOT FORGET THE LAST FORWARD SLASH AT THE END OF THIS URL. /</p>
        <p>rtmp://your-account.srfms.com/webcams<span class="style2">/</span> &lt;&lt;&lt;----- This forward slash </p>
        <p>SAVE the &quot;settings.php&quot; file and upload it to your regular <br />
          hosting server in the root folder of your script.</p>
      <p>Flash Media Server is now setup. </p></td>
